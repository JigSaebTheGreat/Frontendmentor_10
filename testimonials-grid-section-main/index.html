          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were

          ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been
          looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
          amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
          found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
          weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
          completing the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as
          a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù

          ‚Äú I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now

        <p>
          ‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find
          really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be
          able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior
          developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal
          attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing

        <h3>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h3>

        <p>
          ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I
          needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
          programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
          The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
          hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
          project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
          next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve
          often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
          experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
          developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ‚Äù
